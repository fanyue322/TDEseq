# TDEseq
TDEseq is a method for detecting genes with temporal dynamic expression patterns in time-series scRNA-seq  transcriptomic studies. TDEseq models the relationship between log normalized data and the corresponding time points through constrained additive mixed model and can detect the DE genes as well as its temporal dynamic pattern simultaneously.
