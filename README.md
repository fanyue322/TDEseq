# TDEseq
TDEseq is implemented as an open source R package for differentially expressed analysis in time-series scRNA-seq studies.cific methylation information across all individuals, enabling powerful ASM-assisted mQTL mapping. In addition, IMAGE relies on an over-dispersed binomial mixed model to directly model count data, which naturally accounts for sample non-independence resulting from individual relatedness, population stratification, or batch effects that are commonly observed in sequencing studies.IMAGE can identify 50%-64% more mQTL than existing approaches.
